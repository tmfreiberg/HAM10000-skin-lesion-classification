In Steps 3 and 4, the first substep can be done randomly (our default choice), or we can simply choose the \"first\" image in our table that corresponds to the lesion (see ```keep_first``` attribute of the ```process``` class). \n",

    "We explain the balancing procedure by way of example. (This is performed by the ```balance``` method of the ```process``` class in our ```processing``` module.) We assume the dataset has not been filtered, training to validation ratio is $3$, etc. There are $460$ distinct melanoma lesions represented in our training set. As most melanoma are represented by multiple distinct images, there are a total of $831$ distinct images of melanoma lesions in our training set. Suppose we want our training set to contain $2000$ melanoma images: each of the $460$ distinct melanoma lesions will be represented by $2000/460 \\approx 4.35$ images on average. We do not merely sample with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to (a) have as little variance as possible in the number of times a lesion is represented, and (b) use as many distinct images as possible (taking advantage of the fact that there are multiple _distinct_ images of most melanoma). Thus, we note that $2000 = 4\\times 460 + 160$, so we will use each of the $460$ distinct melanoma lesions four times, and make the remainder up by randomly sample $160$ distinct lesions from the $160$. In other words, exactly $300$ distinct lesions will each be represented by exactly four images, and exactly $160$ distinct lesions will each be represented by exactly five images: $2000 = 300 \\times 4 + 160 \\times 5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we select the four images of each distinct melanoma lesion (plus another one image for $160$ of them)? Consider lesion id ```HAM_0000871``` for example: there are three distinct images of this lesion in our data set. Thus, if ```train_one_img_per_lesion``` is ```False```, we will use all three of them, and then randomly select one more (or two more if this particular lesion were to be one of the $160$ that are represented five times). See below. On the other hand, if ```train_one_img_per_lesion``` is ```True```, we have no choice but to use the one image (label ```t1```) four times.\n",

However, we may have multiple images of a given lesion at our disposal: we could make a prediction for each of them and combine them somehow into a single prediction for the lesion. Even if there is only one image of a lesion, we could make multiple predictions on it: if a random transformation is applied to an image before our model makes a prediction on it, this would yield a different array of probabilities each time. Again, we could combine the results into a single prediction.\n",

    "We thought it might be something to do with the size of the dataset module the batch size (```32```), but received no errors for sizes ```44,45```. Also, the number of epochs seemed irrelevant: changing number of epochs to ```1``` or ```2``` while keeping all else constant, had no effect as far as this error was concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted that the error was thrown, at least in some cases (we did not re-check all sizes ```k``` again), not during the training loop, but during validation. We checked the validation sets ```resnet18mc_test._df_val``` that were being fed into the dataloader at this stage, and noticed that for all of the problematic ```k```, and none of the others, there was precisely one image in the validation set. We changed the line ```loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels)``` to ```loss = criterion(outputs, labels)``` in the validation loop, and found that the ```RuntimeError``` was no longer being thrown. We also made the same change to the training loop. We notice that, regardless of the use of the ```.squeeze()``` method, the ```outputs.shape``` seems to always be of the form ```torch.Size([m, 5])``` (when the code works), which is the right shape, making squeezing redundant.\n",
